Buggy 1 : 

Function that caused error : isEmpty(0)

Why it happend: My guess on why it happend is that in the isempty function it probobly was given the wrong index to look for. Perhaps it went below 0;

Buggy 2:

Constructure that caused error : Deck constructure

Why it happened : I belive that is was a problem with setting the size of the deck or adding cards into the deck

Buggy 3:

Method that is wrong: The matches() method written in Card is written incorrectly whilethe decks should match

Why it happend: they don't end up macthing. A possible error could be comparing the wrong things or comparing them in the incorrect order different than what the array list should show.

Buggy 4:

Function: The deal function is broken for a single card deck. 

Why it happend: The initilization and creation of the deck is likley broken because the assertation threw the exception saying it is null. For a single card deck, the constructor likley dosent work.
